3. **Post-max-payout duration extension** (+29.6%, statistically significant)

### **Contradicted Hypotheses**
1. **Post-max-payout peak increase**: Actually shows peak suppression (-23.5%)
2. **Momentum threshold continuation**: Much lower than hypothesized
3. **Sequential momentum effects**: No significant correlations found

### **Key Strategic Insights**
1. **Focus on duration-based predictions** and **ultra-short detection** as most reliable strategies

3. **Recognize systematic risk management** mechanisms that suppress peaks and limit momentum
4. **Understand compound pattern complexity** for advanced strategy development

The analysis reveals that the **Rugs.fun treasury system is more sophisticated** than initially hypothesized, with systematic risk management mechanisms that suppress peak prices and limit momentum continuation, suggesting the treasury system is more sophisticated than initially hypothesized.

**Key Takeaway**: Focus on **duration-based predictions** and **ultra-short detection** as the most reliable exploitation strategies, while avoiding momentum-based approaches that show limited statistical support.
